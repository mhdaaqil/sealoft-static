Sealoft simple static site (HTML + CSS)

How to use (no coding):

1. Download and extract the zip.
2. Open the folder and replace images in the 'images' folder with your real photos (keep the same filenames or edit index.html).
3. To change WhatsApp number: open index.html in a text editor (Notepad on Windows), find all occurrences of '94712345678' and replace with your number (no +, no spaces), e.g., 94771234567.
4. To publish online free: use GitHub Pages:
   - Create a GitHub repo and upload the site files (all files and the images folder).
   - In repo settings -> Pages -> Source: select 'main' branch / root folder and save.
   - GitHub will give you a link like https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name
5. Or upload the folder to any web host (Netlify, Vercel, shared hosting).

If you want, I can upload this site to GitHub for you or walk you through publishing step-by-step.
